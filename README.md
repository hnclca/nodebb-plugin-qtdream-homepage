# Basic CMS plugin for NodeBB - qtdream homepage
![trademark](https://res.cloudinary.com/qtdream/image/upload/v1497926794/cloundinary/xaitlklj5uml8upsiovr.png)

Allows you to define your image based homepage such as youtube.com, youku.com or vimeo.com.
It provides a template named "qtdream.tpl" and "about.tpl".
The former designs a new and good-looking styles for both PC browser and mobile browser,
the latter provides us with a custom template for self-introduction. Maybe good to let others learn yourself.
